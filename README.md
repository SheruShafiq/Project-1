The website is very simple, main landing page is obviously Index.php that is the exact same as the fullIndex except it makes a limited call by checking the session variable about weather the user is logged in or not, the full call and table print is done in FullIndex that can only be accessed
if AUTH key is validated after creating or logging in an account. The data is stored in a database created by the landing page.
